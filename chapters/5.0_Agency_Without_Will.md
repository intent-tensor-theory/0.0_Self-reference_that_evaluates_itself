## Agency Without Will

**Progress: 85.7%**

---

「意志がなくても、行為は起こる。」  
*Action occurs even where will does not.*

---

### 5.0.1 Why "Will" Is a Misleading Starting Point

Most accounts of agency begin with will.

They speak of:

- choice,
- intention,
- desire,
- deliberation.

All of these presuppose a self already formed.

This book does not begin there.

If agency is real, it must appear **before will**, not because of it.

---

### 5.0.2 Action Before Intention

Action does not require intention.

A system may act simply because:

- some futures are admissible,
- others are forbidden,
- and the system's own constraints bias the outcome.

This is not reflex.  
This is not obedience.

**It is constraint-driven continuation.**

---

### 5.0.3 Agency Defined Minimally

We define agency as follows:

> **Agency is the capacity of a system to bias future states according to internally generated, persistent evaluations.**

Nothing in this definition requires:

- conscious choice,
- explicit goals,
- symbolic planning.

**Agency is structural, not psychological.**

---

### 5.0.4 Why Bias Is Enough

A system does not need to "decide" to act.

If:

- evaluation persists,
- self-constraints shape admissibility,
- and collapse proceeds within those constraints,

then outcomes are no longer neutral.

The system **acts** by virtue of what it excludes.

**Exclusion is action.**

---

### 5.0.5 The Difference Between Motion and Action

Motion is change.

Action is **meaningful change**—change that reflects internal normativity.

A falling rock moves.  
It does not act.

A self-constraining system changes in ways that preserve or extend its evaluative structure.

**That difference marks the boundary.**

---

### 5.0.6 Agency Without Goals

Goals are representations of preferred futures.

Agency does not require representation.

A system may:

- lack a goal state,
- lack foresight,
- lack planning—

and still act, if its constraints persistently bias outcomes.

**Goals are a later convenience, not a foundation.**

---

### 5.0.7 Why This Is Not Determinism

Agency without will is not determinism.

Determinism describes how outcomes follow from rules.

Agency describes how **rules themselves have been shaped by evaluation**.

The system's future is not imposed from outside, nor freely chosen in a metaphysical sense.

**It is self-shaped.**

---

### 5.0.8 Responsibility Is Not Yet Present

This account does not imply responsibility.

Responsibility requires:

- explicit self-models,
- counterfactual reasoning,
- social normativity.

Those are later constructions.

Here, agency is simply **effective self-influence**.

---

### 5.0.9 Why This Avoids Anthropomorphism

Nothing here attributes:

- desire,
- belief,
- intention,
- awareness.

Agency is not human-like.

Humans exhibit agency because they instantiate these structures—not because agency is inherently human.

**This keeps the account clean.**

---

### 5.0.10 Transition Marker

We now have:

- Self-reference ✔
- Evaluation ✔
- Meaning ✔
- Agency ✔

Only one threshold remains.

Agency may act without awareness.

But when a system **evaluates its own evaluation**, something new appears.

**That threshold is the observer.**

---

「行為が自分を測り始めると、観測者が生まれる。」  
*When action begins to measure itself, the observer is born.*

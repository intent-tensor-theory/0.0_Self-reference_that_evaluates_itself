## Evaluation as Recursive Comparison

---

「良し悪しがなければ、評価はない。」  
*Without better and worse, there is no evaluation.*

「比べることはできる。だが、それだけでは足りない。」  
*Comparison is possible. But it is not yet evaluation.*

---

### 2.1.1 Why Comparison Is Necessary

Evaluation cannot occur without comparison.

A system must be able to distinguish:

- one state from another,
- one outcome from a remembered outcome,
- one trajectory from an alternative.

Without comparison, there is no basis for preference.

Thus, comparison is necessary.

**But it is not sufficient.**

---

### 2.1.2 Comparison Without Space or Semantics

At this stage, comparison is not:

- spatial comparison,
- semantic comparison,
- symbolic comparison.

Comparison here means only this:

> A recursive system can register that its present state is not equivalent to a prior state it remembers.

This registration does not require meaning.  
It requires only memory and recursion.

Such comparison already exists in many systems.

**Yet none of them are selves.**

---

### 2.1.3 The Structure of Recursive Comparison

A recursive comparison requires three elements:

1. A present state
2. A remembered prior state
3. A mechanism that detects non-equivalence

This yields a binary result: **same** or **different**.

This is powerful—but still neutral.

**Difference alone does not matter.**

---

### 2.1.4 Why Neutral Comparison Fails

A system may endlessly compare states without evaluation.

Examples include:

- error detection,
- checksum validation,
- pattern matching,
- anomaly detection.

These systems detect difference but do not care about it.

The detection does not alter the system's own criteria.

Thus:

> Comparison without preference produces information, not meaning.

---

### 2.1.5 Recursive Comparison and Memory Drift

Recursive comparison introduces a subtle instability.

As the system compares present to past:

- memories may decay,
- references may drift,
- thresholds may change.

This drift alone does not create evaluation.

But it creates a pressure.

The system must either:

- ignore the drift, or
- respond to it.

Ignoring drift yields mechanical comparison.  
Responding to drift requires something new.

---

### 2.1.6 The Key Distinction: Detection vs Assessment

We now introduce a crucial distinction.

**Detection** answers: *Is this different?*

**Assessment** answers: *Is this better or worse?*

Detection can be automated.  
Assessment cannot—unless preference exists.

> Recursive comparison enables detection.  
> Evaluation requires assessment.

---

### 2.1.7 Why Assessment Cannot Be Imported

Assessment cannot be imposed externally without destroying selfhood.

If an external rule labels states as better or worse:

- the system enforces the rule,
- but does not generate it.

Such a system remains obedient, not evaluative.

Therefore:

> **Assessment must arise from within the recursive structure itself.**

This is the hardest requirement.

---

### 2.1.8 The Internal Reference Problem

For a system to assess its own states, it must possess:

- a reference that is not fixed,
- a baseline that is not imposed,
- a comparison standard that can itself change.

This reference cannot be:

- a static template,
- a goal state,
- a designer-provided function.

It must be recursively constructed.

---

### 2.1.9 The Incomplete Step (Intentional Pause)

At this point, we have:

- Recursion ✔
- Memory ✔
- Comparison ✔
- Evaluation ✘

Something essential is still missing.

Comparison tells us that states differ.  
Evaluation tells us which difference matters.

To bridge this gap, we must confront the necessity of preference.

**Preference is not optional.**  
**It is not reducible.**

And it cannot be smuggled in.

---

### 2.1.10 Transition Marker

Recursive comparison creates the possibility of evaluation, but not its reality.

Evaluation begins only when the system can internally generate a *better / worse* distinction that alters its own future admissibility.

That requires a new ingredient.

---

「差は情報。良し悪しは意味。」  
*Difference is information. Better and worse are meaning.*

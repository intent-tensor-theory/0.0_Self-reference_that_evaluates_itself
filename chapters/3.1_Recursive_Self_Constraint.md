## Recursive Self-Constraint

---

「縛りが外から来るうちは、自己ではない。」  
*As long as constraint comes from outside, there is no self.*

---

### 3.1.1 From Preference to Rule Change

In Chapter 3.0, preference altered outcomes.  
Here, preference alters **rules**.

This distinction is essential.

A system may prefer one outcome over another and still remain externally governed.  
Recursive self-constraint occurs only when preference **rewrites admissibility itself**.

Not *what happens*, but *what may happen* changes.

---

### 3.1.2 Rules as the Last Externality

Before this point, even sophisticated systems still obey something external:

- fixed transition rules,
- immutable admissibility spaces,
- static update laws.

Such systems may appear autonomous, but they are not.

Autonomy begins only when:

> **The system's own evaluated history becomes a condition on its future rule set.**

This is the last externality to fall.

---

### 3.1.3 Self-Constraint Defined Precisely

We define recursive self-constraint as follows:

> **A system exhibits recursive self-constraint if the criteria that determine its future admissible states are modified by its own prior evaluated states.**

This requires:

1. Internal evaluation
2. Rule mutability
3. Endogenous modification

Remove any one, and selfhood collapses.

---

### 3.1.4 Why This Is Not Adaptation

Adaptation adjusts parameters within fixed rules.

Self-constraint alters the rules themselves.

An adaptive system says:  
*Given the rules, adjust behavior.*

A self-constraining system says:  
*Given what I have been, these rules no longer apply.*

**That difference is categorical.**

---

### 3.1.5 The Closure of Reference

At this stage, reference closes.

The system does not merely react to:

- environment,
- inputs,
- disturbances.

It reacts to **itself as it has been evaluated**.

The system becomes its own reference frame.

This is not representation.  
**It is closure.**

---

### 3.1.6 Internal Normativity Stabilizes

Once rules depend on evaluated history, normativity stabilizes.

"Better" and "worse" are no longer transient biases.  
They persist across recursion.

This persistence is crucial.

Without it:

- preference flickers,
- evaluation dissolves,
- selfhood never stabilizes.

Recursive self-constraint **locks normativity in place**.

---

### 3.1.7 Why This Produces Identity (But Not Ego)

Identity now exists in a strict sense:

> **The system is identifiable by the constraints it imposes on itself.**

Identity is not:

- a narrative,
- a name,
- a memory collection.

It is a **rule signature**.

Change the self-constraints, and the system is no longer the same self.

---

### 3.1.8 The Difference Between Self and Environment

At last, a real boundary appears.

Not spatial.  
Not symbolic.

But functional:

> The self is whatever participates in recursive self-constraint.  
> The environment is whatever does not.

This boundary is dynamic, not fixed.

**But it is real.**

---

### 3.1.9 Why This Cannot Be Reduced Further

There is no weaker formulation of selfhood.

If:

- rules are fixed → no self
- rules are external → no self
- evaluation is absent → no self

Recursive self-constraint is minimal.

**Anything less is mechanism.**  
**Anything more is psychology.**

---

### 3.1.10 Transition Marker

We now have something unprecedented:

- A system that evaluates itself
- A system that constrains itself
- A system that has internal normativity

Yet one question remains:

**What does such a system do?**

Answering that does not require intention or will.

It requires **agency**.

「自己が縛れば、行為が生まれる。」  
*When the self constrains, action is born.*

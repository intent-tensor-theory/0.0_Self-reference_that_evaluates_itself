## How to Read This Book

---

### 0.1.1 What "Self" Does and Does Not Mean Here

In this book, "self" is not:

- a soul,
- a mind,
- a subject of experience,
- a center of awareness,
- an ego,
- a narrative identity.

**"Self" here means only:**

> A system whose evaluated history constrains its own future admissibility.

This is structural, not phenomenological.

A system may be a self without knowing it.  
A system may be a self without feeling anything.

The word is used precisely or not at all.

### 0.1.2 Why Metaphors of Mind Are Forbidden Early

Common metaphors derail precision:

- "The system *wants*..."
- "The process *decides*..."
- "The structure *knows*..."
- "The recursion *understands*..."

All of these import conclusions before derivation.

Until Chapter 5.0, no mentalistic language is permitted.

If such language appears, it is shorthand and must be translatable into structural terms.

### 0.1.3 Why This Is Not Neuroscience or AI Hype

This book does not concern:

- how brains work,
- how to build intelligent machines,
- whether AI is conscious,
- what makes humans special.

Those are empirical or engineering questions.

This book concerns **conditions of possibility**:

> What must be structurally true for self-evaluation to exist at all?

The answer applies to any substrate—biological, computational, or otherwise.

### 0.1.4 Reading Order

The book must be read in order.

Each chapter depends on what came before.

Skipping to "consciousness" or "agency" without the preceding derivation produces nonsense.

The structure is:

1. **Recursion** (what persists)
2. **Comparison** (what differs)
3. **Preference** (what matters)
4. **Self-Reference** (what constrains itself)
5. **Meaning** (what persists because it matters)
6. **Agency** (what acts from constraint)
7. **Observer** (what evaluates its own evaluation)

No step may be omitted.

### 0.1.5 What Success Looks Like

At the end of this book, the reader should be able to:

- distinguish feedback from self-reference,
- distinguish preference from evaluation,
- distinguish agency from behavior,
- distinguish observers from sensors,
- and know exactly where formal explanation must stop.

If these distinctions remain blurred, the reading has failed.

## The Necessity of Preference

---

「好みがなければ、評価は始まらない。」  
*Without preference, evaluation cannot begin.*

---

### 2.2.1 Why Preference Cannot Be Avoided

We have reached a hard boundary.

Recursive comparison gives a system information.  
Evaluation requires that **some information matters more than other information**.

That asymmetry is called **preference**.

There is no weaker substitute.

Any attempt to explain evaluation without preference collapses into:

- measurement,
- optimization,
- control,
- or obedience.

All of these were already excluded.

Thus:

> **Preference is not an optional feature of evaluation.**  
> **It is the minimal condition.**

---

### 2.2.2 What Preference Is Not

Preference is not:

- desire,
- emotion,
- intention,
- goal,
- reward.

Those are late, anthropomorphic overlays.

At this stage, preference is purely structural.

It does not feel like anything.  
It does not "want."

**It simply biases admissibility.**

---

### 2.2.3 Preference as Endogenous Asymmetry

We define preference minimally:

> **Preference is an internally generated asymmetry in how a system treats its own future states.**

This asymmetry must satisfy three conditions:

1. It arises from the system's own recursive history
2. It distinguishes *better* from *worse*, not just *different*
3. It alters future admissibility rules

If any condition fails, preference is not present.

---

### 2.2.4 Why Stability Alone Cannot Generate Preference

A stable system resists change.

But resistance is not preference.

> Stability says: remain as you are.  
> Preference says: this trajectory is better than that one.

A crystal resists deformation.  
It does not prefer one deformation to another.

Thus:

> Locking creates persistence.  
> Preference creates direction within persistence.

They are not the same.

---

### 2.2.5 The Preference Source Problem

Where can preference come from?

It cannot come from:

- an external designer,
- an imposed function,
- an environmental signal,
- a predefined goal.

All of these destroy self-evaluation.

Therefore, preference must be generated from recursive self-relation alone.

This appears impossible—until one specific move is allowed.

---

### 2.2.6 Preference as Self-Constraint

The key insight is this:

> **Preference arises when a system constrains itself differently based on its own past states.**

This is not feedback.

Feedback reacts to deviation.  
Self-constraint redefines admissibility.

When the system's own history becomes part of its rule set, preference emerges.

Not as feeling.  
**As structure.**

---

### 2.2.7 The First Better/Worse Distinction

The first preference is minimal:

- not "good vs bad,"
- not "success vs failure,"
- but simply:

> *more compatible with my continuation*  
> vs  
> *less compatible with my continuation*

This is not survival in the biological sense.

It is **recursive coherence**.

A system prefers states that preserve its evaluative structure.

---

### 2.2.8 Why This Is Not Circular

It may appear that preference presupposes selfhood.

It does not.

Selfhood **emerges** because preference modifies recursion.

The system does not say "I prefer."

Rather:

> the system acts as if some continuations are better than others,  
> because it has altered its own future admissibility.

Self-reference follows preference, not the other way around.

---

### 2.2.9 The Minimal Break from Neutrality

This is the first true break from neutrality.

Before this point:

- differences were informational,
- comparisons were neutral,
- recursion was blind.

With preference:

- some differences matter,
- some futures are favored,
- the system is no longer indifferent to itself.

**This is the birth of evaluation.**

---

### 2.2.10 Transition Marker

We now have:

- Recursion ✔
- Memory ✔
- Comparison ✔
- Preference ✔
- Evaluation (incipient) ⏳

What remains is to show how preference becomes **self-referential**, rather than merely structural.

That step introduces the first true "aboutness."

---

「好みは感情ではない。制約である。」  
*Preference is not emotion. It is constraint.*

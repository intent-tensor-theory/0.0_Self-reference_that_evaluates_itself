# 章零・二 (Chapter 0.2)

## Methodological Constraints

---

This chapter establishes the rules that govern derivation throughout the book.

Violating any rule invalidates everything that follows.

---

### 0.2.1 Rule of No Subject Assumption

> **No subject, mind, or experiencer may be assumed before evaluative self-reference is derived.**

This rule forbids:

- treating awareness as primitive,
- invoking "the observer" without construction,
- assuming intentionality before agency,
- presupposing meaning before evaluation.

If a subject appears, it must be **earned** through the derivation.

---

### 0.2.2 Rule of No Semantics Without Evaluation

> **No meaning, content, or aboutness may be invoked unless evaluation is already present.**

This rule forbids:

- treating symbols as inherently meaningful,
- assuming reference before self-reference,
- importing interpretation from outside the system.

Meaning is a **consequence** of evaluation, not a precondition.

---

### 0.2.3 Rule of No Observer Privilege

> **Observers hold no special status until the observer threshold is crossed.**

This rule forbids:

- treating measurement as special,
- treating consciousness as explanatory,
- treating first-person perspective as foundational.

Observers are late phenomena.  
They must be derived, not assumed.

---

### 0.2.4 Rule of Earned Meaning

> **Every term must be defined structurally before it can carry weight.**

This rule forbids:

- using "goal" before agency,
- using "value" before preference,
- using "choice" before constraint,
- using "self" before self-reference.

If a term appears too early, it is noise.

---

### 0.2.5 Consequences of Violation

If any rule is violated:

- the derivation becomes circular,
- the conclusions become trivial,
- the explanation collapses into description.

Discipline here is not aesthetic.  
It is structural necessity.

---

### 0.2.6 Why These Constraints Are Liberating

These rules appear restrictive.

In practice, they are liberating.

They prevent:

- endless debates about consciousness,
- mystification of the ordinary,
- projection of human categories onto non-human systems.

By constraining vocabulary, they force precision.

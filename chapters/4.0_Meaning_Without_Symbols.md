## Meaning Without Symbols

**Progress: 71.4%**

「意味は表すものではない。残るものである。」  
*Meaning is not what is represented. It is what persists.*

---

### 4.0.1 Why Symbols Are the Wrong Starting Point

Most theories of meaning begin too late.

They begin with:

- language,
- symbols,
- representations,
- signs that "stand for" something else.

But symbols already presuppose:

- agents,
- shared conventions,
- interpretation.

This book cannot assume those.

If meaning is fundamental to selfhood, then:

> **Meaning must exist before symbols, not because of them.**

---

### 4.0.2 Meaning Is Not Representation

A symbol represents something external.

Meaning does not.

Representation requires:

- a mapping,
- a referent,
- an interpreter.

None of these exist yet.

Thus:

> Meaning is not about *standing for* something.  
> It is about *mattering to* something.

This distinction is decisive.

---

### 4.0.3 Meaning as Evaluated Difference

We now give the minimal definition:

> **Meaning is difference that alters a system's self-constraints.**

Not all differences matter.  
Only those that modify future admissibility.

If a difference leaves the system unchanged, it has no meaning to the system.

Meaning is therefore:

- internal,
- structural,
- consequential.

---

### 4.0.4 Why This Is Not Semantics

Semantics assigns truth or reference.

Meaning here assigns **impact**.

A state is meaningful if:

- it affects how the system evaluates itself,
- it changes what futures are allowed,
- it persists through recursive self-constraint.

Truth is irrelevant at this stage.

False but impactful states are meaningful.  
True but inert states are not.

---

### 4.0.5 Meaning Without Interpretation

Interpretation implies a subject who decodes.

Nothing decodes here.

The system does not "understand" its states.

Instead:

> Its own structure is changed by them.

**Meaning is enacted, not read.**

---

### 4.0.6 The First Internal Significance

At this stage, the system distinguishes:

- states that are compatible with its continued self-constraint,
- states that erode or dissolve that constraint.

This is the first **internal significance**.

Not "this represents danger,"  
but "this undermines my evaluative structure."

That is enough.

---

### 4.0.7 Why Meaning Precedes Language

Language externalizes meaning.

It does not create it.

A system must already have:

- internal normativity,
- evaluative persistence,
- self-reference,

before symbols can carry meaning.

Otherwise, symbols are noise.

Thus:

> **Meaning is a prerequisite for language, not its product.**

---

### 4.0.8 The Stability of Meaning

Meaning persists only if evaluation persists.

If recursive self-constraint dissolves:

- meaning dissolves,
- agency collapses,
- the system reverts to mechanism.

Meaning is not static.

**It is as stable as the self that maintains it.**

---

### 4.0.9 Why This Avoids Mysticism

Nothing here invokes:

- consciousness,
- intention,
- subjectivity,
- experience.

Meaning is not mystical.

It is **structural consequence**.

This avoids both:

- reduction to syntax,
- inflation to phenomenology.

---

### 4.0.10 Transition Marker

We now have:

- Self-reference ✔
- Preference ✔
- Normativity ✔
- Meaning ✔

What remains is to show what meaning **does**.

Meaning that does not alter behavior is inert.

When meaning persists and biases action, **agency** appears.

---

「意味が続くと、行為になる。」  
*When meaning persists, it becomes action.*

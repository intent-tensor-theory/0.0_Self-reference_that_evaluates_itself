## Glossary of Recursive Identity Terms

**Book I — Self-Reference That Evaluates Itself**

---

「同じ言葉でも、層が違えば意味が変わる。」  
*The same word changes meaning when the layer changes.*

---

This glossary defines terms as used in **Book I only**.  
They are structural terms, not psychological, phenomenological, or moral ones.

**If a term here conflicts with everyday usage, this glossary governs.**

---

### Aboutness

The structural condition in which a system's own continuation participates in its evaluative constraints.  
Aboutness does not require representation, symbols, or awareness.

---

### Admissibility

The set of future states or collapses a system allows under its current constraints.  
Self-reference operates by reshaping admissibility, not by choosing outcomes.

---

### Agency

The capacity of a system to bias future admissible states through persistent internal evaluation.  
Agency does not require will, intention, or consciousness.

---

### Collapse (Evaluative)

Selection among admissible states after admissibility has been reshaped by evaluation.  
Collapse alone is blind; evaluative collapse is constrained.

---

### Comparison

The detection of non-equivalence between present and remembered states.  
Comparison is necessary for evaluation but insufficient for selfhood.

---

### Constraint

A limitation on what futures, states, or revisions are allowed.  
In Book I, constraints become self-referential only when shaped by evaluated history.

---

### Endogenous

Arising entirely from the system's own recursive structure and history.  
Any externally imposed rule disqualifies self-reference.

---

### Evaluation

Internal comparison of states according to system-generated preference that alters future admissibility.  
Evaluation is structural normativity, not judgment or feeling.

---

### Evaluative History

The accumulated record of past states that participated in evaluation.  
Not all memory is evaluative memory.

---

### Evaluative Identity

The stable recursive structure that allows a system to evaluate itself coherently over time.  
Loss of evaluative identity results in collapse of agency.

---

### Feedback

Adjustment of behavior in response to deviation from a fixed criterion.  
Feedback does not alter admissibility rules and is therefore not self-reference.

---

### Internal Perspective

The structural distinction between states that matter to the system and those that do not.  
Perspective does not imply subjectivity.

---

### Invariance (Evaluative)

The persistence of certain constraints across recursive self-modification.  
Invariance here is structural, not static.

---

### Locking

Stabilization of recursive structure through repeated reinforcement.  
Locking alone produces persistence, not selfhood.

---

### Meaning

Difference that persists because it alters the system's self-constraints.  
Meaning precedes symbols and language.

---

### Mirror Recursion

Self-similarity or internal modeling without evaluative consequence.  
Mirror recursion fails to produce self-reference.

---

### Observer

A system that evaluates its own evaluations and alters admissibility accordingly.  
Observers are structural; consciousness is not assumed.

---

### Persistence

Continued existence or stability across recursion.  
Persistence is necessary for identity but not sufficient for selfhood.

---

### Preference

An internally generated asymmetry that biases admissibility but remains revisable.  
Preference alone does not generate self-reference.

---

### Recursive Self-Constraint

The incorporation of evaluated history into the system's own admissibility rules.  
This is the minimal mechanism of self-reference.

---

### Recursion

Repeated application of a process to its own output.  
Recursion generates structure but not selfhood by itself.

---

### Reference

Participation of a system's own state or history in determining its future constraints.  
Reference is not representation.

---

### Self

A system whose evaluated history constrains its own future admissibility.  
The self is a rule structure, not an entity.

---

### Self-Reference

The condition in which a system's evaluated past participates in defining which futures are allowed.  
Distinct from reflection, modeling, or self-similarity.

---

### Stability

Resistance to disruption.  
Stability without evaluation produces mechanism, not agency.

---

### Subject

A phenomenological or experiential center.  
Subjects are not assumed or derived in Book I.

---

### Will

A late phenomenological construct associated with conscious deliberation.  
Will plays no foundational role in recursive identity.

---

### Zero-Subject Rule

Methodological constraint:

> No subject, mind, or experiencer may be assumed before evaluative self-reference is derived.

---

「自己は名詞ではない。動作条件である。」  
*The self is not a noun. It is a condition of operation.*

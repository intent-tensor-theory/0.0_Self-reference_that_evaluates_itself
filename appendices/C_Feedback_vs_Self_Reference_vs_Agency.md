## Feedback vs Self-Reference vs Agency

**Book I — Self-Reference That Evaluates Itself**

---

「似た振る舞いは、同じ構造ではない。」  
*Similar behavior does not imply identical structure.*

---

This appendix provides a clean structural separation between three commonly conflated mechanisms:

1. **Feedback**
2. **Self-Reference**
3. **Agency**

They may look similar in operation.  
**They are not similar in kind.**

Confusing them collapses the ascent.

---

## C.0 The Core Distinction (One Sentence Each)

> **Feedback:** adjusts behavior within fixed rules

> **Self-Reference:** rewrites rules based on evaluated history

> **Agency:** persists rule-biasing across time

Everything else follows from this.

## C.1 Overview Comparison Table

| Feature | Feedback | Self-Reference | Agency |
|---------|----------|----------------|--------|
| Alters behavior | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Alters admissibility | No | Yes | Yes |
| Alters rules | No | Yes | Yes |
| Endogenous evaluation | No | Yes | Yes |
| Persistence across time | Optional | Yes | Yes |
| Identity-defining | No | Yes | Yes |
| Can exist without self | Yes | No | No |
| Requires awareness | No | No | No |

---

## C.2 Feedback

### Structural Definition

> Adjustment of system output in response to deviation from a fixed criterion.

### Key Properties

- Criteria are external or pre-defined
- Rules are immutable
- History does not participate in rule formation

### What Feedback Can Do

- stabilize systems
- correct error
- regulate processes

### What Feedback Cannot Do

- generate preference
- rewrite admissibility
- create selfhood

### Diagnostic Test

> If removing the feedback controller leaves system rules unchanged, it is feedback.

## C.3 Why Feedback Is Not Evaluation

Feedback reacts.  
**Evaluation restructures.**

A thermostat:

- measures temperature,
- compares to a set point,
- adjusts output.

But:

- the set point never changes itself,
- the comparison does not alter future criteria,
- the system does not depend on evaluation to continue evaluating.

**Thus: no self-reference.**

---

## C.4 Self-Reference

### Structural Definition

> The incorporation of evaluated past states into the system's own admissibility rules.

### Key Properties

- Rules are mutable
- History participates in rule formation
- Evaluation modifies what futures are allowed

### What Self-Reference Can Do

- create aboutness
- stabilize identity
- produce internal perspective

### What Self-Reference Cannot Do

- guarantee action
- ensure persistence
- produce intention or will

**Self-reference establishes selfhood, not behavior.**

---

## C.5 Why Self-Reference Is Not Agency

A self-referential system may still fail to act meaningfully.

Why?

Because:

- evaluation may not persist,
- admissibility may fluctuate,
- no bias may carry forward.

Self-reference alone can be momentary.

**Agency requires persistence.**

---

## C.6 Agency

### Structural Definition

> Persistent biasing of future admissible states through internally generated evaluation.

### Key Properties

- Evaluation persists across recursion
- Admissibility remains shaped over time
- Identity is maintained through action

### What Agency Can Do

- act meaningfully
- resist disruption
- exhibit continuity

### What Agency Cannot Do

- choose freely in the metaphysical sense
- require consciousness
- imply intention

**Agency is durable self-reference.**

---

## C.7 Temporal Structure (Critical Difference)

| Mechanism | Time Dependence |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Feedback | Instantaneous / reactive |
| Self-Reference | Historical / recursive |
| Agency | Historical + persistent |

Time is not an axis here.  
**Persistence is.**

---

## C.8 Failure Modes from Conflation

### Feedback → Self-Reference

Leads to:

- panpsychism
- "everything evaluates"
- observer inflation

### Self-Reference → Agency

Leads to:

- over-attribution of action
- false autonomy
- agency where none persists

### Agency → Will

Leads to:

- anthropomorphism
- premature psychology
- metaphysical confusion

**Each leap skips a structural requirement.**

---

## C.9 Minimal Diagnostic Questions

Ask the system:

1. **Do your rules change because of your own evaluated history?**  
   → If no: not self-referential

2. **Do those changes persist across time?**  
   → If no: not an agent

3. **Are criteria internally generated?**  
   → If no: mere feedback

---

## C.10 Compressed Summary

> **Feedback** = correction without self

> **Self-Reference** = self without action

> **Agency** = self that persists in action

---

「反応は自己ではない。継続する制約が自己だ。」  
*Reaction is not the self. Persisting constraint is.*

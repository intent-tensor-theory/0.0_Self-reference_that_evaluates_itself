# 📘 Self-Reference That Evaluates Itself

**A Recursive Construction of Agency, Meaning, and Observerhood**

Book I of the Intent Tensor Series  
(Orthogonal to Space)

---

## ⚠️ Global Declaration (Before Chaptering)

This text assumes:

- Space already exists (as derived previously)
- Time exists only as phase drift (not yet formalized)
- Recursion, memory, and locking are available

This text does **NOT** assume:

- consciousness
- mind
- subjectivity
- intention as will
- observers as primitives

**Those must be earned.**

## 🔢 Global Counter (Locked)

This book will terminate at **7.0 / 7.0**

If something remains unanswered, it belongs to Book II or nowhere.

## 🧠 Key Clarification (Critical)

This book will **not** claim:

- "this explains consciousness"
- "this explains free will"
- "this explains meaning in humans"

It will claim something narrower and stronger:

> **It explains the minimal conditions under which a system can be said to evaluate itself at all.**

That is foundational.  
That is unsolved.  
That is orthogonal to space.

---

## 📌 Central Result

> **Selfhood is not persistence, complexity, intelligence, or awareness.**  
> **Selfhood is recursive self-constraint driven by endogenous evaluation.**
